# End-to-EndML
This Ptoject is chapter 2 from "Aurelien Geron - Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow-Oâ€™reilly (2019)"
In this project I will pretend to be a recently hired data analysty. 


For interview purposes, you want to make sure you could recognize which model you want to build
Building it is the easy part, even if you make mistakes, it is normal. 
What is not good is making mistakes in the logic behind choosing the model


Data Anlysis steps:
1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms. 
5. Select a model and train it.

I will build a univriant supervised multiple linear regression model that will use plain batch learning model
You really need to understand the mental map that resulted in this choice.
You got all semster to do so.


6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
